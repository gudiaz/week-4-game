// * If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.
// * When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.

// ##### Game design note:
// ###### The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120
// ###### Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12
